### 1. Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher, Git, and essential libraries for processing audio and text, as specified in the VITS repository requirements. You'll also need `espeak` for phoneme processing.

### 2. Cloning and Setting Up VITS
Start by cloning the VITS repository from GitHub and installing the required packages. If you’re working on Linux, install `espeak` to handle phoneme processing.

### 3. Data Preparation
Organize your dataset into three folders (`train`, `val`, and `test`), each containing `.wav` files for audio and corresponding `.txt` files for transcripts.

#### Audio Processing
Normalize the audio files by setting them to a consistent sample rate (e.g., 16000 Hz) and ensure the transcript files only contain cleaned text without additional metadata or paths.

#### Metadata Generation
Create metadata files (`train.txt`, `val.txt`, and `test.txt`) that link each audio file to its transcript. This format is required by VITS and enables the model to map text to audio during training.

### 4. Configuring VITS
VITS requires certain configurations:
- **Build Monotonic Alignment Search**: Compile this alignment tool for text-to-audio mapping.
- **Preprocess Text for Phonemes**: Run the preprocessing script to convert Tamil text to phonemes, allowing the model to better align text and audio.
- **Edit Configuration**: Update `config.json` with the correct sample rate, cleaners, and paths to metadata files.

### 5. Training the Model
With the configuration in place, initiate the VITS training process. During training, monitor for any issues, such as memory usage or convergence problems, and make adjustments if needed.

### 6. GitHub Integration
Once your setup is ready, initialize a new Git repository in your project directory, add all files (including dataset folders and configuration files), and make your first commit. 

To link this repository with GitHub:
- **Create a repository** on GitHub.
- **Add the GitHub repository URL** as a remote link to your local Git repository.
- **Push** the initial commit to GitHub to back up and share your project.

By following these steps, you’ll have a complete setup for training the VITS model on a custom Tamil dataset and will have the project properly documented and backed up on GitHub.
